Several packages are required for different aspects of  analysis with *R*. 
You will need to install these before starting. 
These packages can be quite large and may take a while to download in the
field. If you have access to a USB key with these packages, it makes sense to
copy and paste the packages into your computer's R package library 
(run the command .libPaths() to see the folder path). 
For help installing packages, please visit https://r4epis.netlify.com/welcome

Please note that this is an INTERNAL document. The AFRO office is requesting your 
honest feedback to better understand the response capacity across the region.

Additionally, the corresponding Excel tool describes the frequency of reporting 
for each indicator. Data is entered into the “Data Fields” tab, and the indicators
in the first tab are automatically calculated. 

The indicators flagged as Weekly should be included in each submission. Indicators
flagged as Bi-weekly should be included in the submissions the first and third 
weeks of each month. Finally, indicators flagged as Monthly should be included 
in the first report submitted for each month, providing data and details on for 
the previous month.

# Section I: Situation Overview 

In this section, please provide a description of the current situation. 

# Section II: Critical Analysis of the Response 

In this section, please provide a critical analysis of ongoing response actions 
by pillar. Please describe areas of progress, (indicators that are in the target

Additionally, please discuss the overall capacity within each response pillar to 
manage and mitigate the pandemic.
